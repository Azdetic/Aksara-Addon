### Auto ExpBottle

Auto ExpBottle is an intelligent armor repair system that automatically throws experience bottles when your armor durability drops below a specified threshold.

#### Features

-   **Smart Durability Monitoring**: Continuously monitors all armor pieces for durability levels
-   **Configurable Threshold**: Set custom durability percentage (1-99%) to trigger auto repair
-   **Selective Armor Checking**: Choose which armor pieces to monitor (helmet, chestplate, leggings, boots)
-   **Flexible Repair Options**: Continue until 100% durability or stop after reaching threshold
-   **Auto Item Management**: Automatically finds and switches to exp bottles, then switches back
-   **Customizable Timing**: Adjust delay between throws to avoid spam

#### Settings

-   **Durability Threshold**: Percentage below which to start throwing exp bottles (default: 50%)
-   **Throw Delay**: Delay between throws in ticks (default: 10 ticks = 0.5 seconds)
-   **Continue Until Full**: Keep throwing until all armor reaches 100% durability
-   **Switch Back**: Automatically return to previous item after throwing
-   **Armor Selection**: Individual toggles for helmet, chestplate, leggings, and boots

#### Usage

1. Enable the Auto ExpBottle module in Meteor Client GUI under "Aksara" category
2. Configure your durability threshold and timing preferences
3. Select which armor pieces to monitor
4. The module will automatically throw exp bottles when armor durability drops below threshold

#### How It Works

The module continuously scans your equipped armor pieces and calculates their durability percentages. When any monitored armor piece falls below your configured threshold, it automatically:

1. Locates experience bottles in your inventory
2. Switches to the exp bottle (temporarily if needed)
3. Throws the bottle to repair armor via experience
4. Returns to your previous item (if enabled)
5. Repeats until armor is sufficiently repaired is actively being developed and will continue to receive updates!
